# Understanding ConvNet 
This work here is inspired from Anuj Shah's video tutorial on visualizing the intermediate layers of convolutional neural network.
You can find the video <a href="http://learnandshare645.blogspot.in/2016/06/feeding-your-own-data-set-into-cnn.html" target="_blank">here</a>. 

Try this [here] (http://learnandshare645.blogspot.in/2016/06/feeding-your-own-data-set-into-cnn.html "title" target="_blank")

I have recited his code with few parameters modified to run on CPU level.
